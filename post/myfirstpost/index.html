  <p>The assignment was to create a 64-bits operating system. Following the 2 videos provided, we started with an x86 compatible OS which is multiboot2 compliant that most bootloaders support. Most of the code for the system is written in C along with some assembly language for the hardware parts.
To set up we need the following tools:</p>
<ol>
<li>Docker for the build environment</li>
<li>qemu for emulating</li>
<li>visual studio code</li>
<li>gcc compiler to run c on visual studio code</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step is to create a docker image. we create a “buildenv” folder containing a docker file and run commands for the installation of necessary packages for example nasm which is needed to compile assembly language.</p>
<p>In the terminal we run “build image using docker build buildenv -t myos-buildenv” to build the docker image. Next to enter the build environment we run “docker run &ndash;rm -it -v &ldquo;${pwd}:/root/env&rdquo; myos-buildenv”.</p>
<h2 id="coding-os">Coding OS:</h2>
<p>Create src folder that has impl folder which holds all the implementation files. Then we create x86_64 assembly code that serves as entry point into OS and integrate it with multiboot2. Next, we have our boot folder that contains the asm files like header.asm where we insert data so that the bootloader can locate the OS that is to be run on the computer. According to the video, we follow multiboot2 specifications. The header contains information about the architecture among other things. The other file in boot folder, main.asm is an entry point into the OS. We create a global start variable in it so that we can access it when linking.</p>
<p>The linker file that explains how to link OS together is in the x86_64 folder in targets folder. In the linker file we use start variable defined earlier to enter. As per convention all our OS data starts in with 1MB.</p>
<p>Now we need an iso file that will hold our OS.</p>
<p>Makefile: Organizes all build commands and makes sure that only things that have been modified get rebuilt so its very fast. In this file we create variables for x86_64 assembly source files and use find command to find all assembly source files. Similarly, we create a variable for all our asm object files as well. We use nasm command to compile assembly code and a phony command that runs in case of modifications in object files.  Our final iso file will be in dist/x86_64 folder. We use linker command to link object files and generate iso file using grub.</p>
<p>Finally in terminal we run “make build-x86_64” to generate the iso file. As shown in the image an iso file has been created in dist/x86_64 folder.</p>

<p>Now we can run “qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom dist/x86_64/kernel.iso -L &ldquo;C:\Program Files\qemu&rdquo;” with path to iso file to emulate the system. After this we will be able to see output ‘OK’.</p>
<p>To convert OS to 64 bit mode we need to switch the CPU into long mode. Following the video, we wrote some assembly code to check that its been loaded by multiboot2 bootloader, to check for CPU ID which gives information about CPU and finally a subroutine to check if CPU supports long mode. We make use of the stack we defined before in these subroutines.</p>
<p>We need to implement virtual memory to enter 64 bit long mode through paging. Paging allows us to map virtual addresses to physical addresses. This is done through page tables that define these mappings that CPU uses to read and write to memory. There are 4 levels of page tables that we define each aligned to 4kb. Using identity mapping we set up the page tables.</p>
<p>This enables us to enter long mode, however, we are still in 32 bit mode. To switch over to 64 bit, we need a global descriptor table that we define in main.asm file.</p>
<p>In the same boot file that has header and main asm files we create a new main64.asm file. We create a global variable “long_mode_start” so that it can be accessed by the main.asm as well. In this file we set the bits to 64 unlike the previous main.asm file.</p>
<h2 id="writing-c-code">Writing C Code:</h2>
<p>Now we get started on our C code that we can use to print a logo using symbols. We create a c file “main.c” to write in the C code. Here we define a kernel_main function that contains several print functions. In the print.h file we define our printing interface. It has different print functions like print_clear, print_str etc that we use to display the logo/text. We include this print.h file in both main.c folder and a new folder we are about to create called print.c. In the print.c file we define all the functions that we saw in the print.h file.</p>
<p>We can use the print_str function in the main.c file to actually print our logo/text as shown.</p>

<p>Lastly, we added variables for the c and kernel source and object files like the ones for the assembly source and object files in the Makefile. And we use gcc to build the c files. In the build command instead of just the asm object files we include all the object files c, kernel and asm.
Now we use the same commands used earlier in the terminal to run the OS and instead of seeing ‘OK’ like we were before, we can see the SEECS text using symbols as shown in the picture.</p>
